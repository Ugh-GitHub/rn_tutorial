Additional options for the form exercise:
1. copy the hex code of a color to clipboard when the user taps on it (leverage the [Clipboard component](https://github.com/react-native-clipboard/clipboard) for it)
2. display a preview of the colors in the modal so the user can see what they're picking
(Pretty much a repeat of the swatch exercise)
3. disable the button if the form is invalid
(Throw in a conditional with the disable attribute)

Did I spark your interest in learning more React Native? I hope so! Here are some topics you might want to look into in your own time:

Animations (honestly it could be a workshop on it's own!): check out the [Animated API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animations) for pure native animations and [Lottie](https://github.com/lottie-react-native/lottie-react-native) (a React Native animation library from Airbnb) for pre-made animations
Images: the built in Image component in React Native is not great, so check out [react-native-fast-image])(https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image)
Bottom tab navigator: most every app has one, but we ran out of time and features. Check out the docs on how to add one [here](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/)
useMemo: it's another React hook and a handy one. I use it a lot. Handy for memoising things. Read more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo)

Advanced topics
If you're serious about building your own app, here are some more advanced tools and libraries you might want to check out:

[CodePush](https://github.com/microsoft/code-push): a tool that all allows you to do over the air updates to your deployed app (kind of how the Expo app works, but you'll be in charge!)
[Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox): an end to end testing framework for React Native
[react-native-testing-library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library): unit testing library for React Native
[Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane): a tool for automating building and releasing your apps
